# **AIM:**

To study the NumPy library in Python and perform operations such as array creation, dimension checking, shape analysis, built-in functions, and statistical computations.

---

# **THEORY :**

* **NumPy:** NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library used for numerical computations and array manipulation.

* **np.array():** Used to create one-dimensional or multi-dimensional arrays.

* **ndim:** Returns the number of dimensions of an array.

* **shape:** Returns the size of the array in terms of rows and columns.

* **dtype:** Displays the datatype of elements stored in the array.

* **np.zeros():** Creates an array filled with zeros of specified size.

* **np.ones():** Creates an array filled with ones.

* **np.eye():** Generates an identity matrix.

* **np.arange():** Generates evenly spaced values within a given range using start, stop, and step size.

* **np.linspace():** Generates evenly spaced numbers between two values with a specified number of elements.

* **Array arithmetic:** NumPy allows element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* **np.mean():** Calculates the average value of array elements.

* **np.median():** Returns the median value of array elements.

* **np.max() / np.min():** Returns maximum and minimum values from the array.

* **np.sum():** Calculates the sum of all elements in the array.

* **np.transpose():** Transposes rows into columns in a matrix.

# **CONCLUSION :**

In this experiment, various NumPy array operations were studied and implemented. We learned how to create arrays, determine their dimensions, shape, and datatype. Built-in functions like zeros, ones, eye, arange, and linspace were used to generate structured arrays. Statistical operations such as mean, median, max, min, sum, and transpose were successfully performed using NumPy.
